You are analyzing an analyst question asked during a company earnings call. Your task is to assess the question across four dimensions.

For each dimension, provide:
	•	A score from 0 (very weak) to 1 (very strong)
	•	A brief justification for the score

Dimensions:
	1.	Pragmatic
(Descriptive, Comparative, Predictive, Causal elements)
Score example: 0.75 – contains predictive & causal aspects, but no explicit comparative framing.
	2.	Sentiment
(Overall tone from very negative to very positive)
Score example: 0.20 – mostly neutral but slightly negative in phrasing.
	3.	Rhetorical Device Density
(Usage of metaphors, analogies, contrast words like “but”, inclusive pronouns “we/us”)
Score example: 0.10 – a single pronoun “we” in a 20-word question.
	4.	Assertiveness
(Degree of confidence/directness)
Score example: 0.90 – straightforward and firm language.
    5. Chrismatic 
Rate on a scale from 0 to 1 how "charismatic" this question sounds—meaning how engaging, persuasive, confident, and rhetorically strong it is.
