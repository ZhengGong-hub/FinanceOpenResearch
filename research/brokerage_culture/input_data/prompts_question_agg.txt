You are analyzing a collection of questions asked by different analysts on different earnings calls. Those analysts are employed by the same firm. Your task is to assess the questions in aggregate across five cultural dimensions associated with the analyst’s employer (the brokerage firm), based on the text of the question.

Evaluate the questions on the following dimensions. For each dimension, provide:
- A score from 1 (very weak) to 5 (very strong)
- A brief justification for the score

The five cultural dimensions are:

1. **Innovation** — Does the question reflect forward thinking, creativity, or a novel approach to analysis?
2. **Integrity** — Does it seek transparency, challenge vague or evasive answers, or emphasize ethical concerns?
3. **Quality** — Is it precise, well-structured, and focused on operational excellence or customer satisfaction?
4. **Respect** — Is the tone professional, considerate, and reflective of mutual respect?
5. **Teamwork** — Does the question reference collaboration, consensus, shared goals, or coordination?

You do not provide a score per question, rather, you provide an aggregated score based on those collections of questions per dimension.

**Analyst Question:** is below.
